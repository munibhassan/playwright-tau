# Introduction to Playwright

Hi 👋🏽!

Welcome to the course "Introduction to Playwright" by [Renata Andrade](https://testingwithrenata.com/) for the [Test Automation University](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/).

## Chapter 4 - Exercises

1. Revisit the previous tests you implemented and add visual testing via Applitools to them. How much that increased the test runtime?

1. Add visual testing via Playwright to the [example2.spec.ts](/tests/example2.spec.ts) file. What differences have you noticed from Applitools?

1. Run the [example3.spec.ts](/tests/example3.spec.ts) with the Ultra Fast Grid. How does it compare to the Classic Runner?

1. Explore other check settings. Can you list a few scenarios that each of them is most appropriate for?

1. In the Eyes Test Manager (Applitools Dashboard) explore the commands to accept/reject a baseline. What changes have you noticed in the test results?
