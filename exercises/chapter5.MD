# Introduction to Playwright

Hi 👋🏽!

Welcome to the course "Introduction to Playwright" by [Renata Andrade](https://testingwithrenata.com/) for the [Test Automation University](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/).

## Chapter 5 - Exercises

1. Make a few other tests fail and explore the reports. What new things have you observed?

1. Debug a test via VS Code Playwright extension and also via Playwright Inspector. What differences have you noticed? What is the best option in your opinion and why?

1. Explore the option `await page.pause();` to debug a test. Is it helpful? How is that compared to the Playwright Inspector and VS Code extension?

1. When running the tests in UI, activate the [watch mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode#watch-mode) and update a few tests. What happens?
